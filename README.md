# Hi, I'm Marie

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nycodeghg)

I live in germany and really like building and deploying software, especially using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

After high school, I aim to work as a DevOps Engineer, but I'm not quite sure on that yet :)

You can reach me using the social media links on [my website](https://marie.cologne).
